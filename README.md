## Optical Transport Network
### OTN protocol
OTN is often referred to as a "digital wrapper" because it encapsulates each client or service transparently into a container for transport across optical networks, preserving the client's native structure, timing, and management information. This enhanced multiplexing capability allows OTN to carry different traffic types, including IP, Ethernet, storage, digital video, and SONET/SDH, over its framing structure, which is a key reason for its widespread adoption.

Since its inception in 2001, OTN has evolved beyond merely being a SONET/SDH wrapper. It has been optimized to support Ethernet, today's most popular client service, ranging from 1GE to 400GE. OTN-enabled technology is foundational for next-generation optical networks, supporting flexible packet technologies that include new Ethernet interfaces, Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Segment Routing, and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). OTN technology has been extensively deployed worldwide, covering a wide spectrum of applications. Hundreds of thousands of OTN ports are now in operation, carrying mission-critical traffic from the network edge to the metro and core, as well as in submarine applications.

The OTN wrapper is made up of several components in a hierarchy as depicted in  Figure 1

The Optical Transport Module (OTM) is the information  structure transported across the optical interface. It has two parts: a digital  structure and an optical structure. The Optical Channel Payload Unit (OPU)  contains the payload frames. The payload area of the OPU structure is comprised  of end-user services such as IP, Ethernet, or any other protocol. The OPU  overhead is associated with the mapping of client data into the payload area. The  Optical Channel Data Unit (ODU) contains the OPU overhead and payload area,  plus additional overhead such as BIP8, GCC1/2, Tandem Connection Monitoring (TCM),  and so on. The ODU represents the OTN path service within an OTN network.

## Key Advantages and Why OTN:

### OTN (Optical Transport Network) Key Advantages:

1. Backward Compatibility:
OTN is fully backward compatible, allowing it to be built on existing SONET/SDH management functions. This ensures complete transparency for existing communication protocols and provides end-to-end connectivity and networking capabilities for WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing). OTN also offers specifications for optical layer interconnection for ROADM and enhances sub-wavelength aggregation and grooming capabilities.

2. Comprehensive Network Coverage:
The OTN concept encompasses both the optical and electrical network layers, inheriting the dual advantages of SDH and WDM. Key technical features include:

#### Various Client Signal Encapsulation and Transparent Transmission:
The OTN frame structure, based on ITU-T G.709, supports the mapping and transparent transmission of various client signals such as SDH, ATM, and Ethernet. ITU-T G.sup43 provides supplementary recommendations for varying degrees of transparent transmission for 10GE services. Standardized mapping methods for GE, 40GE, 100GE Ethernet, Fiber Channel (FC) for private network services, and Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) for access network services are still under discussion.

#### Large Granularity Bandwidth Multiplexing, Cross-Connection, and Configuration:
The electrical layer bandwidth granularity defined by OTN is the Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk, k=0,1,2,3), i.e., ODU0 (GE, 1 Gbps), ODU1 (2.5 Gbps), ODU2 (10 Gbps), and ODU3 (40 Gbps), with the optical layer's bandwidth granularity being the wavelength. Compared to SDH's VC-12/VC-4 scheduling granularity, OTN's multiplexing, cross-connection, and configuration granularity are significantly larger, enhancing the adaptability and transmission efficiency for high-bandwidth data client services.

#### Robust Overhead and Maintenance Management Capabilities:
OTN provides overhead management capabilities similar to SDH. The OTN frame structure at the Optical Channel (OCh) layer significantly enhances the digital monitoring capabilities of this layer. Additionally, OTN offers six levels of nested Tandem Connection Monitoring (TCM) functions, making it possible to perform end-to-end and multi-segment performance monitoring simultaneously during OTN networking, providing suitable management methods for cross-operator transmission.

#### Enhanced Networking and Protection Capabilities:
With the introduction of OTN frame structures, ODUk cross-connection, and multi-dimensional reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADM), OTN significantly enhances networking capabilities. The adoption of Forward Error Correction (FEC) technology significantly increases the transmission distance in the optical layer. Furthermore, OTN offers more flexible service protection functions based on both the electrical and optical layers, such as Optical Channel Connection Protection (SNCP) and shared ring network protection based on the ODUk layer, and optical channel or multiplex section protection based on the optical layer.


### Advantages of OTN include:

Hybrid scheduling capabilities at the optical wavelength and electrical levels.
Ultra-long span and ultra-long distance transmission capabilities, supporting multi-level cascading functions with electrical relay regeneration, reaching relay regeneration transmission distances of tens of thousands of kilometers.
100G/200G single boards in OTN can provide wavelength tuning capabilities. Wavelength adjustment is achieved through tunable wavelength modules, which can be adjusted within the 50GHz interval of the C-band 96-wave range. Tunable wavelength technology avoids the fixed wavelength conversion of traditional WDM, greatly facilitating service activation and enabling flexible wavelength allocation.
Users can flexibly network, achieving smooth transitions from 10G systems to 100G systems. In mixed-rate scheme design, apart from common issues like transmission distance and channel spacing between different rate signals, channel interference between different modulation formats is also considered to ensure system transmission performance.
With the continuous growth of information levels and service bandwidth, OTN, as a derivative of DWDM, inherits and combines the advantages of SDH and WDM, expanding network functions suitable for service transmission needs. In network applications, there are significant improvements in scheduling capabilities, service access capabilities, and network management and monitoring capabilities, meeting the quality requirements of new services. With the advent of the 5G era, OTN technology will become more prevalent in the market, marking a necessary trend in future network development.
